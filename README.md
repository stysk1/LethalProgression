# Lethal Progression

The Company has been trialling new suit upgrades, no one knows what inhalents they're pumping through the suits.

As you collect scrap for the company you will be rewarded with points to spend to pump more inhalents into your suit to become the perfect employee.

---

This mod adds a XP based GUI levelling system with a range of upgrade types to spend your points on.

The original mod was created by [Stoneman2](https://github.com/stoneman2/LethalProgression). [TisRyno](https://github.com/TisRyno/LethalProgression) rebuilt and maintained it with significant improvements. This fork brings it up to v81.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Everyone needs this mod for it to work

## How does it work?

### Level up yourself and the crew:
- Assigning points is as simple as 2 clicks!
- Build your character's stats and coordinate with your team on what role you should be.

### General Configuration:
- Levels can be configured within the config editor from Thunderstore or r2modman.
- You can configure:
    - Starting Skillpoints (default 5)
    - Minimum XP to level up
    - Maximum XP to level up
    - Level requirement increase per player (balances larger lobbies) 
    - Level requirement increase per new quota.
    - Change when players can remove points from skills
        - Allow only in orbit is the default
    - Keep progress after being fired

### Skill-based Configuration
Each skill is built up of 3 settings:

#### Skill Enabled
If the skill is enabled and available to players.

#### Skill Max Level
Maximum number of points the skill can have.

#### Skill Multiplier
The multiplier applied per level put into a skill.
_As an example, if the Battery Life skill has a multiplier of 5, then for each skill point put into Battery Life the battery will extend by 5% and 4 points in Battery Life will increase the battery by 20%._

### XP gain:
- Depositing loot on the ship adds the Loot value as the XP amount.
    - The multiplier from the Loot Value skill is ignored.
- Killing enemies give everyone XP.
    - This is currently a hard-coded list of enemies and their relative value, eventually this will be a configurable setting.

## Compatibility:
- Any mod which affects Hand Slots is likely to be incompatible at present
- Some mods that change what scrap has spawned in, or it's value, occasionnally overwrite the Loot Value perk
    - This mod has been built to attempt to be compatible with BrutalCompanyMinus

## Host Commands

The host can grant skill points to players via the in-game chat:

```
/levelup                  # grant 1 point to yourself
/levelup 3                # grant 3 points to yourself
/levelup PlayerName       # grant 1 point to a player
/levelup 3 PlayerName     # grant 3 points to a player
```
